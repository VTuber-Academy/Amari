Amari is a versatile Discord bot designed to enhance the VTA (VTuber Academy) community by facilitating efficient back-end operations and promoting engaging interactions. With features such as VTuber, Artists, and Staff applications, ModMail, Silent Levelling, Radio, and more, Amari aims to streamline community management and create a vibrant and enjoyable atmosphere. Built using the sapphire.js framework in Node.js, Amari incorporates additional components to ensure Test-Driven Development (TDD) practices for robust and reliable performance.

## Features ðŸ“º
- Written in Typescript
- Test Driven Development (TDD)
- Uses [sapphire.js's amazing bot framework](https://github.com/sapphiredev/framework/)
- Easy setup with multi guild functionality in mind

## Installation & Usage ðŸ”»
1. To get started with this Amari, clone the repository and run:
```bash
pnpm install
```
2. It will install all dependencies required by the bot including devDependencies. This is **required** to build the bot files for production. Now its time to store your bot token! Your env file is stored inside src/.env
  - **Do not share your token with anyone! Keep it safe as if its a password for you!** -- If you do not know how to get a bot token, refer to this [article](https://discord.com/developers/docs/getting-started#adding-credentials).
- I recommend you use [visual studio code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with [prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode), [better comments](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=aaron-bond.better-comments) and [vitest](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ZixuanChen.vitest-explorer) extensions installed or similar when developing with Amari.
3. If you want to run your bot, just do `pnpm dev`! Though this is not really recommended during production. To be safe run `pnpm build` and then `pnpm start`
- Incase you want to remove devDependencies for your production server, run `pnpm install --prod` at the end of the command line! (removes dev dependencies)
